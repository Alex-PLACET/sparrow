     * @brief C++ proxy class for managing ArrowArrayStream objects.
     *
     * This class provides a C++ interface for working with ArrowArrayStream objects as defined
     * by the Arrow C Stream Interface specification. It manages the lifetime of the stream and
     * provides convenient methods for adding and retrieving data chunks.
     *
     * The Arrow C Stream Interface is designed for streaming data exchange between different
     * libraries or components within a single process. A stream exposes a source of data chunks,
     * where each chunk has the same schema.
     *
     * Key features:
     * - Automatic resource management through RAII
     * - Type-safe push/pop operations for array data
     * - Schema validation when adding arrays
     * - Proper implementation of all mandatory ArrowArrayStream callbacks
     *
     * Thread safety:
     * - The stream is not thread-safe by design (per specification)
     * - Concurrent calls to get_next or pop must be externally synchronized
     *
     * @note This class implements the producer side of the Arrow C Stream Interface.
     *       It creates streams that can be consumed by other libraries that understand
     *       the ArrowArrayStream C interface.
     *
     * @see https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html
