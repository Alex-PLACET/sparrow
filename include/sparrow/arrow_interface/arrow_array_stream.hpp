 * @file arrow_array_stream.hpp
 * @brief Implementation of the Arrow C Stream Interface for streaming data exchange.
 *
 * This file provides a complete implementation of the Arrow C Stream Interface as specified at:
 * https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html
 *
 * The Arrow C Stream Interface defines a standard C API for streaming Arrow data between different
 * libraries and components within a single process. It uses a pull-based iteration model where
 * consumers request data chunks one at a time.
 *
 * Key components:
 * - ArrowArrayStream: C structure with callbacks for stream operations (defined in c_stream_interface.hpp)
 * - arrow_array_stream_proxy: C++ wrapper providing RAII and type-safe operations
 *
 * @see https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CStreamInterface.html
 * @see https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html
